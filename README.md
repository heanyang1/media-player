# My Vibe Coded ~~Trash Bin~~ Tool Box

This project is an experiment for me to try vibe coding while making something useful (at least to me). most of the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files are written by GitHub Copilot's and Windsurf's free tier.

All tools are static web pages.

## List of Tools

- Hacker News: Retrieves and displays the latest stories from Hacker News using the [Hacker News API](https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/topstories.json). Sometimes it is faster than visiting the HN site. 
- Media Player: A media player on a static web page. It (only) supports playing files uploaded by the user.
- Relic Interpreter: An old version of [Relic](https://github.com/heanyang1/relic).
